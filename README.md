01.Problem Hello Python
Writing Python code requires no additional preparation – creating a file with the .py extension is all we need. So let's directly proceed with writing our first line of code. We will write the following command:

print('Hello Python')

02.Problem: Expression
Write a console-based Python program that calculates and prints the value of the following numerical expression:

(3522 + 52353) * 23 - (2336 * 501 + 23432 - 6743) * 3
Note: you are **not allowed to previously calculate the value** (for example with Windows Calculator).

03.roblem: Numbers from 1 to 20
Write a Python console program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 on separate lines on the console.

07.Problem: Program That Converts Levs (BGN - Bulgaria's currency) , into Euros
Let's have a look at another simple program that reads a number of levs(BGN) from the user, converts them into euro (divides them by the euro exchange rate) and prints the result. This is a program of three consecutive commands. Enter and execute them in sequence:

leva = int(input())
euro = leva / 1.95583
print(euro)
